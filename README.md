# barfspace

This is a repository of works-in-progress and other not-ready-for-primetime writing that I do.

I had previously kept a few of these as uncomitted files in my workspace for [Meditations][], back before they were merged into [Lean Notes][] (not comitting them because I felt they weren't finished enough to publish), but eventually decided I'd rather maintain them in a perpetual work-in-progress repository.

Basically I came up with a notebook format that was easily publishable to the web, then slapped a domain name on it. The fact that these notes are public is, in general, an afterthought - it's less that there's anything to gain from making them public than that there's nothing to gain from not doing so (all it does is make it harder for me to share them, or refer to them in a pinch when I'm not signed in / haven't installed Evernote or Google Keep or Laverna or Penciltape or whatever the kids are using these days).

All of the content in this repository can be found by following links from at least one of the following pages:

- [Right Now][], the successor to my Planfile
- [News][], the flip side of recording ephemeral state
- [Musings][], a home for the kinds of aforementioned not-ready-for-prime-time meditations barfspace was originally created for
- [Raw emotional stuff][raw]
- [Project ideas][projects]
- [Silly shit][tumblr]
- [the barfspace meta collection][meta], containing files that were kept separate in a directory called "docs" back when most of the content lived in named files at the root
- [Appendices][], single-document clearinghouses for various bite-sized thoughts
- [The Rest][]: for when I really, really, really don't want to classify something as any of the above
- [Loose Notes][]: for ideas that don't even warrant their own page, and don't already have a suitable appendix page I can figure out right when I need to start writing them. I can tear them off and give them pages (possibly sorted, even) or move them to an Appendix later.

Yeah, a lot of these are messy and could use an editor, or are woefully incomplete and in dire need of someone to help fill in the gaps (or at the very least take a stab at filling them in). If you think you'd like to do that, check out the [standing policy on contributions][contributions].

## Also

I'm putting [my-old-bad-ideas.md][] right *here* right now, because it should really be expanded once I've finished mutating the hierarchy like this and have a bit of a better writing-about-barfspace situation set up than the old "docs" folder
