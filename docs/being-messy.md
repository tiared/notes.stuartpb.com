# The Sincerity of Sloppiness

This is an attempt to consolidate some of the thoughts that have been lingering around in meta-textual messes like hemingway-style.md and the-thing-about-weird-twitter.md.

In fact, fuck it, I'm going to go ahead and merge those files into this one.

Actually, no, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to iterate by rewriting what I wrote there... like *actual, honest to god drafts*. Shit, this repo might be making me adopt generally-accepted good writing habits. Shit.

Mania doesn't come naturally to me, and I'm not super comfortable within it. Last Friday, I tried slopping out some text here in barfspace in a manic dash to express myself, and I felt drained, more drained than I necessarily had to.

Keeping things tidy feels *good* to me, in some contexts. It's ironic, because my apartment is always a mess, but my *work*, I can't stand a single stray hair in the logic of.

But I worry that my *natural style* being this semi-rehearsed, practiced, rhythmic thing makes it come off as less raw, more processed, less *trustworthy* than a nigh-inscrutable ee-cummings-style tone poem primal scream where the syntax melts, the words go Humpty-Dumpty, and irony comes and goes as it pleases.

I guess that might be part of the motivation behind what I would feel is "my truth" in barfspace, where I'm just being *me*, in the way that feels most comfortable: it shows that this *is*, in fact, how I roll, how I write off the cuff, how I lay my thoughts out when I'm not trying to obscure anything I already understand.

I don't know: I guess I *did* pause there, writing that last clause, trying to ponder the way to convey the precise sentiment that was on my mind in a way that could be understood.

***But that's who I am.*** Being understood is of the *utmost importance* to the core of my being: the only thing that *really* bothers me is being misunderstood, and I don't know how other people can put up with it. Writing something that could potentially be misunderstood, without taking a minute or less to smooth it out, feels not just *unnatural* to me: it feels *morally wrong*, which is why I was left feeling drained on Friday. It's wrong on the order of using a linear-time algorithm where a constant-time soultion would do: it's putting a burden on a potentially *interminable number of readers* that could have been entirely resolved by *one person* making more of an effort.

And it's not just failing to satisfice: it's not an *infinite* cycke of indecision - indeed, as I've built up this skill, it usually terminates fairly *quickly* (as I said, usually within the course of a minute).

Hmm, now that I think about it... that's probably a better value for the shotclock.
