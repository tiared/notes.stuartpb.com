so, the shot clock in autocommit.sh is a thing I'm still kind of coming to terms with, its purpose etc. Like, I've started deleting things now that I feel I can rely on commits to track if I ever go back and think "wait, actually there might have been some value there".

part of me feels like this is a betrayal of the original intentions behind making this barfspace repo, but, nah, because the point was to make something where I'm not fussing over "oh, is this good enough to ship", and I'd say I've achieved that

See, it's important for me to keep in mind that the point of autocommit and the shot clock... that a big motivation of why I added autocommitting at *all* is that I wanted to be free to delete stuff. the point *wasn't* to lock me into endlessly generating noise, it was to force me to ship when I feel like the point where I'd really want to cut the commit was "later"

like for instance, with that last line I actually did get a second of "oh, wait, should I keep going, do I have more to say", and then I took somewhere around ten seconds to think about it, and then autocommit was just like "NAH BRO, 'S GOOD ENOUGH" and, you know what, that was pretty much the right call
