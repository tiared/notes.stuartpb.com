## BOB (from Twin Peaks)

An incarnation of wild evil and madness, one who hides in seemingly-pure communities and insidiously corrupts them, with some being fully aware that he's there, and everyone else thinking the people who know of BOB are just crazy.

BOB is a terrifyingly apt metaphor for how broken stairs fester.

## J.R. "BOB" Dobbs

I mean, I don't honestly know much about the SubGenius folks, but I do see them as sort of the Catholics of Discordianism, and, you know that thing where religions will take side-swipes at very-closely-neighboring religions that they don't really bother to understand? I'm cool letting "BOB" live right here like that for now.
