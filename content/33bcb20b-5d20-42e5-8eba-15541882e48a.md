# Fixer Arc

This is a combination of a few different arcs that only had one quest when I forked them out from [Quests][].

[Quests]: 6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md

## Repair Quests

We can rebuild them. We can make them better than they were.

### The Broken Headphones

These are still a perfectly good pair of Bluetooth headphones, it's just that the one hinge is broken. You know, that headband was never all that comfortable in the first place...

- [ ] See if you can get the headband disassembled for replacement.

## Papercut Quests

Sometimes, it's the little flaws it feels best to solve.
