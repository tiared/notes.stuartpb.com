# Unusual Studio Quest Arc

It would be cool if you could just go online and show people the things you're up to. (Oh, well, I guess [Quests][] sort of count, but something a bit more live than that.)

[Quests]: 6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md

## Test Run

- [ ] Take on one of these other quests on-stream.
- [ ] Start using Quests here as "TODO" items on the Projects page (or start moving quests here to places that'd be more appropriate)?
  - [ ] This will probably be accomplished by putting all my "TODO" documents under their own pages in this repo, honestly, it's pretty freeing.

## Quest Structure

- [ ] Spend more time with this Quests structure before making further plans to integrate it into Unusual Studio.
- [ ] Maybe it would make sense to sort these "Quests" under both Arcs and Projects?
  - [ ] Allow users to vote / pay in at any level, and funds will be divided up beneath that somehow (evenly?)
  - [ ] The infrastructure to associate Projects to Quests is already in place (the "TODO" link points to a document giving a project's quests, in one form or another)
- [ ] Not all quests should be Unusual Studio Quests. How would it make sense to draw that line?
- [ ] Find a way to associate odd jobs into Unusual Studio, if not by using Quests.
  - [ ] Quests also work pretty well as Agendas, just saying...

## Bluetoot the Loveable Sidekick

- [ ] Program a server that will make sounds out of a Bluetooth speaker on certain stream events.
