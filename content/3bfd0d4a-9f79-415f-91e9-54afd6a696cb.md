## Charlie Chaplin

Saint Casper, the Holy Ghost

## Bruce Lee

Total badass who died of opiates for chronic pain. Pallbearers included Steve McQueen, Chuck Norris, James Coburn, and George Lazenby, most of who are in a Pantheon themselves.

## Probationary Saints Second Class

- Slavoj Zizek is a probationary Saint Second Class, even though he'd claim, as a pervert, he should go in the Other Good One
- Stephen Fry isn't a standup comic so he's allowed to be a probationary saint
